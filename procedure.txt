12/02: first settings.



12/02.2: Understanding the excercise:

-The network was configured before us.
-It seems the network has problems with connection.
-It seems ip addresses are wrongly formatted. They should have the IP address that
appear under each device.
-What I have to do is to enter each device and corroborates that each IP address is
the same than the number given below.
-Once finished, to make a ping to each other devices (this means 2 pings).
-According to teacher, subnet mask should be always the same: 255.255.255.0 (for 3
devices).
-If we hover the mouse, then we'll get that info easily. Thats not the idea. The idea
is to access to the switch from a pc.



#CONFIGURING PC IP


.1.Connect a pc with a switch with a console cable.
.2.IP address PC1: 192.168.0.2. Standar subnet mask.
.3.Click over pc of the left. Click in desktop. CLick in IP´configuration.
I notice the IPV4 address is: 111.111.111.111. I suspect i have to change it.
.4.Click over the pc of the right. CLick in IP´configuration.
I notice the IPV4 address is: 222.222.222.222. I suspect i have to change it.
.5.#ACCESS THE SWITCH AND ANALIZE SAME FEATURE, FOR NOW.
