12/02: first settings.
12/02: understanding the connection between pc and switch for obtaining
switch ip address.



12/02.2: Understanding the excercise:

-The network was configured before us.
-It seems the network has problems with connection.
-It seems ip addresses are wrongly formatted. They should have the IP address that
appear under each device.
-What I have to do is to enter each device and corroborates that each IP address is
the same than the number given below.
-Once finished, to make a ping to each other devices (this means 2 pings).
-According to teacher, subnet mask should be always the same: 255.255.255.0 (for the 3
devices).
-If we hover the mouse, then we'll get that info easily. Thats not the idea. The idea
is to access to the switch from a pc.



-Whats interface FastEthernet0?

Data packets layer that works MAC addresses of the devices of the LAN.



#ANALISIS OF PCs IP

.1.Connect a pc with a switch with a console cable.
.2.IP address PC1: 192.168.0.2. Standar subnet mask.
.3.Click over pc of the left. Click in desktop. CLick in IP´configuration.
I notice the IPV4 address is: 169.254.103.52 (IN DHCP). I suspect i have to change it.
.4.Click over the pc of the right. CLick in IP´configuration.
I notice the IPV4 address is: 169.254.190.199 (IN DHCP). I suspect i have to change it.
.5.#ACCESS THE SWITCH AND ANALIZE SAME FEATURE, FOR NOW.
.6.Tried to ping a pc from another one. Was succesful in DHCP protocol.
.7.When we set the static mode, then the IP addresses are like: 111.111... &
222.222.222...


#Conclusion1:
-Both pcs are working wrong. The IP address of each one has to be modified to the
given uder each pc.
-Try to access to the switch from a pc for checking out its configuration.



-whats a fastethernet0 connection between pc and switch in cisco packet tracer?

Fa0 is a type of interface of switches and routers. It mainly depends on the 
networks speed.

There are some types of inerfaces:

GigabitEthernet(GigE): up to 1 Gbps speed.
Ethernet: up to 10 Mbps speed.
Wireless



-how is a fastethernet0 connection between pc and switch in cisco packet tracer?

.A console cable is the proper one. This cable allows communication to the serial
port of the pc. The pc serial are the COM ports.
.This cable allows the access to the switch CLI.

#STATIC & DHCP IN SWITCH
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/switches/cisco-350-series-managed-switches/smb5557-configure-the-internet-protocol-ip-address-settings-on-a-swi.html

.A switch can have multiple IP Addreses.
.Each IP address can be assigned to each port, interface, VLAN, or Link Aggregation
Groups (LAGs)

.A switch IP Address can be manually configured or automatically by DHCP server.
If there's no DHCP server available, then switch will use factory default IP address
which normally is: 192.168.1.254



@16/02.1:

#CONFIGURE STATIC IP ADDRESS

The swtich is set up without DHCP server.

.1.Open the switch.-enable.-configure t.
.2.-switch(config)#interface [interface-id | vlan-id
-Switch(config)#interface vlan 1 #Allows to configure vlan1 for IP config.
NOTE: the VLAN interface has to already exists in the switch.

#VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

.Are separate virtual networks for grouping the devices connected to the switch.
.Design department and accounts department doesnt have to share data. So we create
a VLAN for design, and another one VLAN for accounts.
.As a virtual network, it doesnt matter the physical location of the decives inside
the LAN.



.3.-Switch(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Now the VLAN interfface has a IP address and subnet mask.

.4.-Switch(config-if)#no shutdown
Eanbles the data traffic in the interface. Even when we configure the IP address, its
still in a "down" state. So by doing this, we up the interface.

.5.-Switch(config-if)#end 
Goes back to privileged mode.

.6.-Switch#show ip interface 
It shows the configuration of the ports.

.7.-switch# copy running-config startup-config
It saves the changes made on the device in non-volatile memory.

.8.switch# show running-config
It displays the configuration. Including changes I made.
